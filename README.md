# README

This readme will serve as a journal of my experiences developing this program, my thought processes and my struggles.
I have never attempted a project of this complexity, already I've had to develop new skills and an understanding of CMake as a build system
of CLION as an IDE, how to integrate packages into a C++ project. Working with libraries I've never used before, namely the Poco library and it's networking
components and TCPServer class. 

This program is not intended to be used in any real capacity, it is a project I am working on out of my own interest and as a method of developing my skills
as a programmer and a developer. This program will have a lot of edges, but I will do my best to ensure that it is designed in a thoughtful and coherent way.

More Readme stuff to follow. You know when there's more here. 

Additionally - This repo contains only the code for the c++ backend, right now the "front-end" is a simple python program. I may continue to develop the front-end
in python with a GUI or I may pivot and develop it in another language, I'll most likely stick with Python though because the client does not need to do very much.
